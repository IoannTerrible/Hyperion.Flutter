What is Hyperion?
Hyperion is a modular, extensable platform that acts as a universal client for external services and APIs.
It runs as a desktop or server app and lets users connect, manage, and automate stuff with different systems (like web services, platforms, or local APIs) through a plugin-based architechture.
Each Hyperion instance can run multiple plugins, each handling a specific integration or task, while the core platform gives unified control, state management, and security.
Hyperion Mobile is the companion app used to monitor and control these Hyperion instances remotly.

What kind of app are you making? What does it do?
I'm building a mobile control and monitoring app for managing distributed instances of a platform called Hyperion.
The app lets users:

* sign in to their account,

* see devices where Hyperion is running,

* view multiple Hyperion instances per device,

* monitor enabled plugins and their health,

* enable or disable plugins remotely,

* manage active user sessions.

The app isn't a universal REST client and doesn't let you edit API requests.
It's basically a remote control panel for existing Hyperion instances.

What is the app name?
Hyperion Mobile

What are other similar apps on the app store?
There aren't direct equivalents, but similar ideas show up in:

* Portainer Mobile (for Docker container monitoring)

* Grafana Mobile (monitoring dashboards)

* Firebase Console Mobile (project and service overview)

* UptimeRobot (service health monitoring)

These apps mostly focus on monitoring and limited control of backend systems.

How is your app idea better than these?
Hyperion Mobile stands out because it:

* manages multiple instances across multiple devices, not just a single service,

* works with dynamic plugins, not predefined integrations,

* is platform-agnostic (not tied to Docker, cloud providers, or one API),

* provides remote control, not just read-only monitoring,

* is designed for technical users who want a fast, minimal, actionable UI.

Instead of being a generic monitoring tool, Hyperion Mobile acts as a universal control layer for a customizable backend platform.
